# Lisbon Trip Guide (16th-22nd January)

## General Information About Portugal and Lisbon

Portugal is a country rich in history, culture, and traditions. Situated in the Iberian Peninsula, it boasts a diverse landscape, from golden beaches to rolling vineyards. Lisbon, the vibrant capital, is one of the oldest cities in Europe, dating back to Roman times. Its strategic location made it a significant settlement for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Moors. Lisbon flourished during the Age of Discoveries (15th-16th centuries), when explorers like Vasco da Gama charted new sea routes. This era brought immense wealth to Portugal, reflected in the iconic Manueline architecture. However, the city suffered setbacks like the devastating 1755 earthquake, followed by a resilient recovery that shaped its modern-day charm. Today, Lisbon blends ancient history with a thriving contemporary culture, evident in its colorful streets, historic trams, and fado music.

### Jewish History in Portugal
The Jewish community in Portugal has a long and tumultuous history. During the Middle Ages, Portugal was a haven for Jews fleeing persecution in Spain. However, in 1496, King Manuel I issued a decree forcing Jews to convert to Christianity or leave the country. Many Jews became "New Christians," secretly maintaining their faith. The Inquisition in Portugal led to trials and executions, leaving a dark chapter in Jewish history. Despite these hardships, the community’s resilience is evident in preserved landmarks like the Shaare Tikva Synagogue and Rossio Square, where the Inquisition once operated. Modern Lisbon celebrates its Jewish heritage through cultural events, synagogues, and historical tours, showcasing the profound impact of Jewish culture on Portuguese history.
